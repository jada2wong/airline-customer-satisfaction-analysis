  - Data Preparation
  - Exploratory analysis
  - Linear Regression / Logistic Regression
  - Associate Rules

# Project Task Breakdown

  1. Data Preparation
  - Loaded and transformed raw data
  - Applied Data Cleaning
  2. Exploratory analysis
  - Observe relationship between demographic data/customer behavior and satisfaction score 
  3. Linear Regression / Logistic Regression
  - Applied both regressions
  - Based on the coeffients of each variable, found factors that has a higher possibility 
  towards low satisfaction score
  4. Associate Rules
  - In-depth analysis : figured what combination of variables with highest association to the
